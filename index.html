<p>Welcome to the website for the 2020 Software Fellow Project posters.</p>

<p>This year, our site visit from the National Science Foundation will be virtual. Since printed posters on the wall of MolSSI doesn't work well with a virtual visit, we are taking a different approach to software fellow posters this year.</p>

<p>Please contribute a "virtual poster" for this site. You will need to fork this repository and add a post. The pages are formatted using markdown. For a guide see the post "How to add your Poster" (which also shows an example of what posters will look like)</p>

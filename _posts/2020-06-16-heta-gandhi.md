## Introduction

Machine learning is a powerful and flexible toolset that can be used alongside molecular dynamics simulations to improve accuracy and learn underlying distributions and characteristics of a system of interest. Here we demonstrate the use of a new software method that connects the machine learning library TensorFlow with the molecular dynamics engine HOOMD-blue, with specific application to Coarse-Grained (CG) simulations.

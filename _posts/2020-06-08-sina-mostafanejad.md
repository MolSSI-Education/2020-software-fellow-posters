## Introduction

The development of an accurate and efficient model for the description of electron correlation
effects is an active area of research in quantum chemistry and molecular physics.
Although single-determinant-based models such as Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) have been 
successfully applied to a wide variety of molecular systems, they often exhibit dramatic 
failures towards strongly correlated systems with dominant multireference character. In such
cases, multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) offers a possible remedy 
towards a robust and economic deliniation of strong and weak correlation effects. The efficacy
of MC-PDFT stems from highlighting the complimentary strengths of multireference methods and DFT
to account for static and dynamical correlation effects, respectively.

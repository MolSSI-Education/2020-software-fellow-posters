## Introduction

Although Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) [1, 2] is one of the most widely used method for chemical computations, its applicability is still signiﬁcantly limited by system size. A calculation in larger systems can be achieved by fragmenting the full system into smaller pieces. The full-system properties can then be obtained from the corrected fragments through an embedding potential. A growing community of researchers working under the umbrella of “embedding” methods are pursuing this direction [3–6]. Our group has developed Partition DFT (PDFT) [7–9], an embedding method where fragment densities {nα(r)} rather than the full molecular density n(r) are used as main variables. The use of these fragment densities simpliﬁes calculations and provides a direct connection to the full-system KS-DFT. The exact embedding potential of PDFT (termed vp(r)) is unique for a given choice of fragmentation. This is a distinguishing feature of PDFT compared to other embedding schemes that can have multiple optimal embedding potentials and sets of fragment densities [10]. The uniqueness of vp(r) provides a convenient way to develop approximations and to test their performance. In addition, PDFT allows for non-integer numbers of electrons in fragments. This feature has the advantage of producing localized fragment densities and facilitating connections to chemical reactivity theory [11]. Applied to small molecules, PDFT has been shown to ﬁx the ubiquitous errors [12, 13] from which density functional approximations suﬀer. In the case of bond stretching, a simple approximation to vp(r) in combination with a local density approximation (LDA) for the fragments, can ﬁx the static-correlation and delocalization errors [14]. With the proposed implementation, we hope to extend this success to more complex chemically interesting molecules

You can include equations:

$$ \vec{F} = - \nabla U $$

$$ \vec{F} = m \cdot \vec{a} = m \cdot \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = m \cdot \frac{d^{2}\vec{r}}{dt^{2}}$$

and code:

{% highlight python wl linenos %}
import numpy as np

for atom1 in atoms:
    for atom2 in atoms:
        a1 = atoms.index(atom1)
        a2 = atoms.index(atom2)
        coor1 = coordinates[a1]
        coor2 = coordinates[a2]
        distance = np.sqrt(np.sum((coor1-coor2)**2))
        if 0 < distance <= 1.5:
            print(F'{atom1:2} to {atom2:2} : {distance:.3f}')

def hello_world():
    print("hello world")

{% endhighlight %}

## Adding your poster

### Fork the repository

This website uses a Jekyll template on GitHub pages. You will add your poster by adding a markdown file and editing a yaml (directions below). You will need to Fork [the Repository](https://github.com/MolSSI-Education/2020-software-fellow-posters) and submit a pull request to have your poster added.

### Create a branch on your fork

Create a branch to work on.

```bash
$ git checkout -b YOUR_NAME
```

### Add your picture

Add a picture of yourself to `assets/images/avatars/`. This is the picture that will show up in the left sidebar for your poster. This picture is pretty small, so please be careful to resize your image appropriately. Please save your image as `firstName_lastName.jpg` (or whatever file extension you are using)


You should edit your name and links to websites. If you do not have one of these or don't want to include one of the options, remove that entry starting with "label". 

### Add a post for your poster

To add a poster, go to the `_posts` directory in the top level of this repository. You can copy this file as a starting point. Change the file name so that the file name is `YEAR_MONTH_DAY-firstName-lastName.md`. 

### Submit a pull request

Once you have finished your poster, push to your fork and submit a pull request on the main MolSSI repo.

## Poster Headings and Sections

The Table of Contents on the right will be rendered automatically based on your poster sections. Sections should be labeled using `##` markdown tags.

## Including Extras

Here are some directions on how to include extras like images, equations, and code. Not that you should not copy and paste the examples from the markdown file (rendered page is fine), as the examples in this section have some special characters so that the code can be rendered on the site.

### Images

If you include images on your poster, please make a directory for your poster under `assets/images`. Please make the directory name your name so that the path to your images will be `assets/images/FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME/`.

For images to show up on your poster, you must use this syntax. You can use the example in the Introduction (NSF logo).

```markdown
![Figure Label]({{ "{{ site.url" }} }}{{ "{{ site.baseurl" }} }}/assets/images/FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME/your_image.png)  
***Figure 1**: The logo of the National Science Foundation.*
```

### Code

There are a few ways you might include code snippets in this template. For the first two (markdown highlight tag and using back tick characters) you will include your code on the page. For the GitHub gist, you create a gist on GitHub and embed the script.

#### Highlight tag

Surround your code with a special tag. This example will highlight a code and add line numbers.

```markdown
{{ "{% highlight LANGUAGE wl linenos " }}%}
  YOUR CODE HERE
{{ "{% endhighlight "}}%}

```

#### Backticks

If you don't want line numbers you can use three backticks to start a code block, and three backticks to end the code block. The language should follow the first three backticks.

````markdown

```LANGUAGE

  YOUR CODE HERE

 ``` 

````

#### GitHub Gist
You can embed code from a GitHub Gist. If you have a gist, you can get the code for your script on the page for the gist by copying the code from the 'Embed' button. It will look something like this:
```
<script src="https://gist.github.com/janash/7607581a759172ac45efd12c8ca38687.js"></script>
```

### Equations
Equations are supported through [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org). MathJax allows you to use LaTex format for your equations. Here are some example equations

```
$$ \vec{F} = - \nabla U $$

$$ \vec{F} = m \cdot \vec{a} = m \cdot \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = m \cdot \frac{d^{2}\vec{r}}{dt^{2}}$$
```

And you can see more documentation [here](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/basic/mathematics.html).

## Previewing the site locally

You can preview this site locally by installing [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Once you have jekyll installed, you can preview the site by doing

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

in the top level of this repository. A preview of the site will be lon `localhost:4000/2020-software-fellow-posters/`

## Introduction

Advanced potential energy surfaces and models are being applied to an
ever-expanding array of problems in structural biology, drug design and
characterization of novel materials. These new potentials incorporate explicit
polarization effects and are calibrated very closely against energy
decompositions derived from electronic structure calculations. The Tinker
molecular modeling packages constitute one of the leading code families
implementing the AMOEBA (Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular
Applications) force field and many other advanced potential energy models.

As a new member of the Tinker suite, `tinker.gpu`
(get it from [GitHub](https://github.com/zhi-wang/tinker.gpu)) will focus on
accelerating the advanced force fields and enhanced sampling methods with novel
parallel algorithms on the state-of-the-art GPU devices.

## Advanced Force Fields

### Quadrupole Electrostatics

### Polarization

### Charge Transfer

### Dispersion and Repulsion

### Advanced Sampling Methods

## Code Structure

Even though `tinker.gpu` is written in modern templated C++, we will not give
up all of our legacy Fortran code base. As a matter of fact, this program still
depends on the pre-built Fortran Tinker subroutines and modules to manage the
file I/O and global variables. The C++ is also the layer to launch OpenACC or
CUDA kernels at runtime, as well used for unit tests.

### Legacy Fortran Subroutines and Modules

### Templated C++ Functions

### Templated OpenACC and CUDA Kernels
<!-- minimal communication and synchronization -->

### Unit Tests

## Old Example

This is a template to create an online poster for your software project.

You can include equations:

$$ \vec{F} = - \nabla U $$

$$ \vec{F} = m \cdot \vec{a} = m \cdot \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = m \cdot \frac{d^{2}\vec{r}}{dt^{2}}$$

and code:

{% highlight python wl linenos %}
import numpy as np

for atom1 in atoms:
    for atom2 in atoms:
        a1 = atoms.index(atom1)
        a2 = atoms.index(atom2)
        coor1 = coordinates[a1]
        coor2 = coordinates[a2]
        distance = np.sqrt(np.sum((coor1-coor2)**2))
        if 0 < distance <= 1.5:
            print(F'{atom1:2} to {atom2:2} : {distance:.3f}')

def hello_world():
    print("hello world")

{% endhighlight %}

## Adding your poster

```markdown
![Figure Label]({{ "{{ site.url" }} }}{{ "{{ site.baseurl" }} }}/assets/images/FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME/your_image.png)
***Figure 1**: The logo of the National Science Foundation.*
```

#### Highlight tag

Surround your code with a special tag. This example will highlight a code and add line numbers.

```markdown
{{ "{% highlight LANGUAGE wl linenos " }}%}
  YOUR CODE HERE
{{ "{% endhighlight "}}%}

```

#### Backticks

If you don't want line numbers you can use three backticks to start a code block, and three backticks to end the code block. The language should follow the first three backticks.

````markdown

```LANGUAGE

  YOUR CODE HERE

 ```

````

#### GitHub Gist
You can embed code from a GitHub Gist. If you have a gist, you can get the code for your script on the page for the gist by copying the code from the 'Embed' button. It will look something like this:
```
<script src="https://gist.github.com/janash/7607581a759172ac45efd12c8ca38687.js"></script>
```

### Equations
Equations are supported through [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org). MathJax allows you to use LaTex format for your equations. Here are some example equations

```
$$ \vec{F} = - \nabla U $$

$$ \vec{F} = m \cdot \vec{a} = m \cdot \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = m \cdot \frac{d^{2}\vec{r}}{dt^{2}}$$
```

And you can see more documentation [here](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/basic/mathematics.html).
